## My thoughts on Github

### __**Stuff I like**__
1. Can make _websites_ using it
2. Holds repositories with many useful tools
~~3. the word git reminds me of hillbillies and it makes me laugh~~
4. Good for collaboration
+ either on the same files
+ or on multiple parts of a larger project

### __**Stuff I Don't Like**__
1. The work flow is confusing
2. People that aren't prompt with answering pull requests
