# This markdown file is for the first exercise of the class to familiarize ourselves with working with Github and Git within the Gitbash terminal


## Things that I find confusing about Git:
1. To utilize a form of markdown, I had to clone the repository from Github and I cloned it to my desktop. Now, I can no longer delete it off of my desktop. What did I do wrong and how can I remove it?
2. I do not really have anyone to work through all of this with so I've been having to learn on my own (outside of class) and it can be difficult at times. I'm learning, it is just rough translating what you want to do in your mind into code that the terminal can read.


Useful commands | Description
--- | ---
git status | Check for the status of a local file
git log | Check the log of snapshots and commit messages
git branch | Check which branch you are on
nano README.md | Make changes to a markdown file in terminal called "README.md"
mkdir | Make a directory
cd | Change directory


_My research involves working with maize sweetcorn and field corn genotypes to identify [spontaneous haploid genome doubling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154852/) by genomewide association and QTL mapping. Computation skills will help with my research as the GBS data I am trying to work with is a 5M SNP file that is just too large for any desktop to work with. Therefore, obtaining experience using Gitbash and the cluster is needed to run analysis for my research. I can run GWAS, just working with such large datasets is what has been giving me troubles and I'm optimistic that this class will help in that._
