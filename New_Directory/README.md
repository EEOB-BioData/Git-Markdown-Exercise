## Computational skills in my research

BCB546X will provide guidance and opportunities to practice computational skill that will prove to be extremely valuable as I progress in my PhD research.

One of my projects is an RNA-seq expression analysis that requires understanding Unix and R. I have already worked through a majority of the data processing using Unix and am about to begin data visualization and analysis using R.

Another project I am planning to potentially pursue is using sequencing to look for methylation patterns associated with a nutrient stress response which will require similar computational skills as my RNA-seq expression analysis.
